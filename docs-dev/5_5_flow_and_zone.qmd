# Flow and Zone

Enabling a flow state is one of the most sought-after achievements for a game. While conventional video game design may focus on the balance of challenge versus progression, as a learning platform there are additional considerations. 

The enjoyment is in the learning, in the perfect balance between player skill and the challenge presented.

The five most common experiences of game feel are:

- The aesthetic sensation of control
- The pleasure of learning, practicing and mastering a skill
- Extension of the senses
- Extension of identity
- Interaction with a unique physical reality within the game

The Feel of Everyday Things

Every new animator has to learn these principles. They comprise a universally applicable set of non-negotiable aesthetic guidelines.

Game Narrative Design is the art of telling a story in a computer game using the techniques and devices available. It is the art of using gameplay and the sum of visual and acoustic methods to create an entertaining and engaging experience for players.

In his book Finding Flow, Csikzentmihalyi and his colleagues studied people in a state of *flow*, identifying eight factors that define the optimal state for getting in the zone:

- a challenging activity requiring skill 
- a merging of action and awareness 
- clear goals 
- direct, immediate feedback 
- concentration on the task at hand 
- a sense of control 
- a loss of self-consciousness 
- an altered sense of time 

The application to video games is compelling and provides a useful measure for evaluating the game experience and potential satisfaction of the player. The role of the flow state in games was a point of specific mention for Csikzentmihalyi, observing how games have been *developed over the centuries for the express purpose of enriching life with enjoyable experiences,* as excellent producers of flow in human beings.
