### Loving Vincent

Credited as the first-ever fully painted feature film, _Loving Vincent_ is about the journey of a man named Armand Roulin, who travels to deliver Vincent Van Gogh's last letter to the late painter's brother. Vincent Van Gogh had died one year prior, and Armand, in his travels, attempts to learn what he can about the circumstances surrounding the impressionist painter's death. Artists painted each frame to mimic the art style of the beloved painter, creating a masterful piece dedicated to one of the most beloved figures in art history. Its sheer beauty counts _Loving Vincent_ among the best animated movies for adults, but it is also so much more.
