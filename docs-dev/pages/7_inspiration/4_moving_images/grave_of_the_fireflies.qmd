### Grave Of The Fireflies (1989)

_Grave of the Fireflies_ centers on a pair of siblings as they seek to survive the end of World War II in the city of Kobe, Japan. In the first few moments of the film, it is revealed that both have passed away, and the rest of the movie is a flashback about their journey. This, however, does nothing to cushion the blow of the crux of this truly tragic movie. Apart from being one of the best animated movies for adults, it should be noted that _Grave of the Fireflies_ is a highly emotional experience that not all viewers are prepared for. However, its valuable lessons about humanity make it a must-see.
