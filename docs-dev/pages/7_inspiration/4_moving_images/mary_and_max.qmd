### Mary And Max (2009)

Inspired by his relationship with his own pen pal in New York, writer-director Adam Elliot made _Mary and Max_, a stop-motion animated dramedy about an isolated Australian girl and the overweight American with whom she exchanges letters. The movie’s use of colors to represent its characters, from Max’s dreary noir-tinged palette to Mary’s warm sepia tones, is exemplary, while the story itself is a heartfelt testament to the virtues of human interaction in all its forms. _Mary and Max_ counts among the best animated movies for adults for being extremely effective at juxtaposing its child-friendly animation style with deeply adult themes.
