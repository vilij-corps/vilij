### Fantastic Planet (1973)

On the planet of Ygam, humans are minuscule in comparison to the Traags from this world. Humans are considered to be animals and are thus kept as pets and even hunted. A young Traag adopts a human child after the human's mother is killed by Traag children. This starts a series of events that show the world in a much larger scope. Animated in the '70s' signature psychedelic visual style, _Fantastic Planet_ reveals the sheer depth that can be explored through "trippy" cartoons and high-concept sci-fi elements. To this day, _Fantastic Planet_ is largely lauded as one of the best animated movies for adults, especially viewers looking for a new spin on the apocalypse.
