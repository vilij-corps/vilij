### Isle Of Dogs (2018)

Despite the adorable dogs in its ensemble, _Isle of Dogs_ is not a movie for kids. Its violence was tame enough to avoid an R rating, but it’s still pretty disturbing. In fact, _Isle of Dogs_ is one of the best animated movies for adults for the way it tackles historical traumas. After adapting Roald Dahl’s _Fantastic Mr. Fox_ as a stop-motion animated feature, Wes Anderson returned to the medium for the story of a near-future Japan in which canine flu leads to all dogs being banished to a trash-filled island. Moreover, while many adult animated movies and stop-motion films do not make a lot of money, _Isle of Dogs_ is actually one of Wes Anderson's highest-grossing movies.
