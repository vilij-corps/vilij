### Ghost In The Shell (1995)

Mamoru Oshii’s original _Ghost in the Shell_ movie from 1995 remains a timeless classic of the cyberpunk genre. Apart from touching on challenging themes surrounding transhumanism and institutional politics, _Ghost in the Shell_ is an example of how combining traditional cel animation and computer graphics was already perfected back in the '90s. The movie’s influence on _The Matrix_ franchise was so strong that the Wachowskis apparently pitched the project to studios by screening _Ghost in the Shell_ and telling executives they wanted to basically just do that but in live-action. _Ghost in the Shell_ ranks highly among the best animated movies for adults.
