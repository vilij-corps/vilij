### Waking Life

Richard Linklater put a surreal, philosophically engaging spin on the structural style of his debut feature _Slacker_ with _Waking Life_, an animated odyssey about a man bouncing from dream to dream in search of the answers to life’s biggest questions. The film contains meditations on existentialism, the meaning of life, and the paradox of free will. Linklater achieved the animation by shooting digital video of actors and recruiting animators to rotoscope over the footage, and it is considered one of the best animated movies for adults, particularly for those in search of a deeper meaning to existence.
