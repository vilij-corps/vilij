### Persepolis (2007)

Marjane Satrapi adapted her own autobiographical comic book for the screen with her Oscar-nominated masterpiece _Persepolis_, a coming-of-age story about a girl growing up during the Iranian Revolution. It was heavily influenced by Satrapi’s own experiences in West Asia. Although the story specifically speaks to Iranian experiences, it deals with universal themes and can be enjoyed by anybody with a heart. While _Persepolis_ strangely remains an underrated gem, it's not just one of the best animated movies for adults, but also one of the greatest period movies, ever.
