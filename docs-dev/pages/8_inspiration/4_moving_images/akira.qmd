### Akira (1988)

Set in dystopian Neo-Tokyo, _Akira_ is one of the defining works of cyberpunk cinema. When Tetsuo Shima acquires telekinetic abilities in a motorcycle crash, he uses those abilities to take on corruption in the city, eventually going after the oppressive political powers. The global success of _Akira_ helped to popularize anime in the western world, and to call it one of the best animated movies for adults would be an understatement. Apart from laying the groundwork for contemporary cyberpunk itself, _Akira's_ overarching themes, animation style, and even actual shots continue to influence sci-fi and fantasy to this day.
