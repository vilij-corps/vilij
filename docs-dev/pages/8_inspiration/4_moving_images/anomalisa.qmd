### Anomalisa

Adapted by Charlie Kaufman from a play he wrote under the pseudonym Francis Fregoli, _Anomalisa_ is a stop-motion animated movie starring puppets who are made to feel human by the compelling vocal performances of David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Thewlis plays a customer service guru who perceives everyone in the world to be identical until he meets a woman, played by Leigh, who stands out. The first R-rated adult cartoon to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, _Anomalisa_ is one of the **best animated movies for adults** in search of a beautiful and muted character piece.
