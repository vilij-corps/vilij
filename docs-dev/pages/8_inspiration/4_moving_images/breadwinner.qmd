### The Breadwinner (2017)

Set in 2001 during the Taliban's control over most of Afghanistan, _The Breadwinner_ centers around eleven-year-old Parvana. After her father is unjustly imprisoned, Parvana must provide for her family. She dresses as a boy to get around Taliban laws and plans to rescue her father. The film is beautifully animated and is a heartfelt and inspiring story of a child's determination to help her family amid their war-torn surroundings. Rated PG-13, _The Breadwinner_ is sometimes considered a family film, but the events onscreen not only make it one of the best animated movies for adults, but also ultimately more suited for mature audiences.
