### The Animatrix (2003)

Set in the world of _The Matrix_ trilogy, _The Animatrix_ is an anthology movie that explores the events prior to when machines rose up against humanity. _The Animatrix_ features nine short stories, and through seven different directors and animation styles, it unravels what viewers knew all along: humans have no one to blame for the machine revolt but ourselves. By enhancing the lore and history behind the live-action movies in ways that fully leveraged the various animation styles of its directors, _The Animatrix_ remains one of the best animated movies for adults. While it’s not as great as the iconic first chapter in _The Matrix_ trilogy, _The Animatrix_ is objectively much better than the sequels.
