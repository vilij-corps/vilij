# Caveat Emptor

Unless otherwise indicated (specifically by updating this note), we have a few noteworthy strengths and weaknesses to share.

### Subject Matter Non-Experts

We know what we don't know...

- language content has been provided by **native speakers**.
- however, the current team does not have any **linguistic** or **language teaching** expertise.
- the project would greatly benefit from **subject matter experts** in the linguistic and language learning field.

### Learning Playground 

Let's learn and have some fun!

- the game play world represents our best effort to replicate the sights and sounds of a country location to **respectfully** portray the people and places to the greatest extent possible.
- there will be no intentional direct or indirect references to politics, propaganda, or messaging that can be construed as having an agenda other than to **promote language learning, cultural understanding, and entertainment**.
