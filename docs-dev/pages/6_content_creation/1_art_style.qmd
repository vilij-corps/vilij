It was at the time of this writing that famed Colombian artist **Fernando Botero** passed away at 91 years old. His signature style, known as *Boterismo*, is the perfect example of earning a namesake art style, instantly recognizable for it's originality. The New York Times referred to him as the *Artist of Whimsical Rotundity*, words well chosen when considering the unmistakable characteristics of his artwork, making him *one of the world’s best-known artists*.

It's a tall order to achieve such greatness in establishing a video game art style, but let us try, an effort surely to have better results than lazy imitation.

## What shall we call it?

In so much as a masterpiece is physically formed from little more than a canvas and paints, the artistry is a skillful combination of vision and choices. Let's take a close look at a few key *choices* that will influence the art style of our world:

-   Emotional / Sensational: to represent the state of feeling \| sense and/or provoke a state of feeling \| sense.
-   Selective: to capture the essence of an interesting moment.
-   Stylized: an artistic mark that deviates from the photographic image.
-   Idealized: favoring the optimistic, positive image and/or identity of the subject.
-   Realism: it exists in the real world, but represented with some artistic transformation, while retaining the truth and honesty of the source.

In artistic terms, we might generically call this combination a form of **figurativism** emphasizing that the imagery is derived from real sources. But there are a few key points to highlight that serve to differentiate the style from a purely shape and form depiction. Our representation seeks to capture the deeper meaning, symbol, and feeling presented on the game canvas and how we immerse the player into our painted game world. Let's take an example to explore this further.

"I’m using a lot of photographic reference for this project — especially for the prologue. About half the images are directly from photos, while the others use photos as a resource, but the angle (and many details) come out of my head." -- Josh Neufeld
