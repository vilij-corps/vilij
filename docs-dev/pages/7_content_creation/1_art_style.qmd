## Inspiration

It was at the time of this writing that famed Colombian artist **Fernando Botero** passed away at 91 years old. His signature style, known as *Boterismo*, is the perfect example of earning a namesake art style, instantly recognizable for it's originality. The New York Times referred to him as the *Artist of Whimsical Rotundity*, words well chosen when considering the unmistakable characteristics of his artwork, making him *one of the world’s best-known artists*.

It's a tall order to achieve such greatness in establishing a video game art style, but let us try, an effort surely to have better results than lazy imitation.

### What is it?

Style in art refers to an artist’s unique combination of techniques, processes, and decisions. It develops and evolves over the lifetime of an artist.

A distinct style can help with an artist’s branding and recognition. Many people could recognize

The art styles in game refer to all the art in the game’s look, including the characters, lighting, colors, etc. As we all know, some games look different.



The style relates the form with technique and the choice of expression of the artist.

"No top grossing game is a fragmented mix of a mechanic and an Art Style, instead, they are all well designed and intentionally build experiences that hold all its elements together. Top grossing games always communicate their content very well, and their mechanics, visuals, sound and theme work as one to materialize the experience."

## What shall we call it?

stylized realism

In so much as a masterpiece is physically formed from little more than a canvas and paints, the artistry is a skillful combination of vision and choices. Let's take a close look at a few key *choices* that will influence the art style of our world:

-   Emotional / Sensational: to represent the state of feeling \| sense and/or provoke a state of feeling \| sense.
-   Selective: to capture the essence of an interesting moment.
-   Stylized: an artistic mark that deviates from the photographic image.
-   Idealized: favoring the optimistic, positive image and/or identity of the subject.
-   Realism: it exists in the real world, but represented with some artistic transformation, while retaining the truth and honesty of the source.

In artistic terms, we might generically call this combination a form of **figurativism** emphasizing that the imagery is derived from real sources. But there are a few key points to highlight that serve to differentiate the style from a purely shape and form depiction. Our representation seeks to capture the deeper meaning, symbol, and feeling presented on the game canvas and how we immerse the player into our painted game world. Let's take an example to explore this further.

"I’m using a lot of photographic reference for this project — especially for the prologue. About half the images are directly from photos, while the others use photos as a resource, but the angle (and many details) come out of my head." -- Josh Neufeld


## Recipe

When we want to create a game to be a global hit, we have to face the problem of the perception of visual delight, beauty and emotions in large scale. Your goal is to create beauty and fun for a huge number of people, folks around the globe with different sociological and cultural contexts, that’s when the thing got really tricky. -- Rafael Marquetto
