# Stylized Post Processing


The look development process begins with reference imagery and a model that has defined shapes, but may not have all of the details. A Look Development Artist adds displacement and/or procedural geometry to finalize the shapes before adding all of the color, texture, and material properties through layers of masks and expressions.

Look development is the artistic process of defining how computer-generated characters or scenes appear using texture, shading, lighting, and compositing.

In terms of coverage, look development can be divided into all the major areas of a game or movie: character design, environments, and props.
