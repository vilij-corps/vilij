# Truthful Realism

> Right from the beginning I always strived to capture everything I saw as completely as possible. -- Norman Rockwell

### photorealism

Photorealism of a character is frequently highlighted as the pinnacle achievement in video game graphics. Although advances in computer power and software have made significant progress in this area, photo, stylized, and surreal forms of realism have been achieved for centuries by master artists. For ==KOMPRENI?==, that mastery has a heavy influence on the style and representational design choices we've taken in creating the game environment. So let's take a closer look...

Take for example, the famed American artist Norman Rockwell. Norman Rockwell's style of painting is often called **photorealism**. Indeed, he would eventually use photographs that he took himself to guide his painting, but suggesting his style is a photocopy misses the essence of his work.

This is especially true if we consider the current state of photorealism achieved with modern day 3D authoring software and game engine environments. Advances in technology have enabled us to make real-to-life recreations almost indistinguishable from the physical representation. But the reproduction of a photograph is rarely the true expression of artistry or the full measure of a work of art.

### How did he do it?

According to XXX, Rockwell took a *stand above and beyond any other artist of his time against prejudice, bigotry, inequality, and against stereotypes that keep us from living the lives we desire.* He was also described as *having his finger on the pulse* of the images he created. This view was earned from his art work and the stories conveyed from his meticulous attention to detail, imagination, and artistic vision.

The artistic decisions he took to transform a model or photograph to canvas is something we prefer to describe as a form of *emotional-realism* -- emphasizing his mastery for capturing a moment in life that evokes a sense of feeling.

What can we learn from Rockwell and others like? The lessons are especially important as we try to create a realistic sociological environment to give us inspiration for our learning and experiences to practice in a way that resembles meeting and talking with people as closely as possible.

The message here is hopefully worthy of notice. Technology and technical ability can not over take the efforts for bringing life to characters and environments. Taking lessons from Rockwell's talent to create artworks, a.k.a. game assets, that capture the essence of people and places, we follow these basic principles:

1.  Every character shall be hand painted with the expressions, gestures, and other characteristics relevant to the situation.
2.  Every scene will be created from real-life observed and captured images, as true and completely as possible.

This leads to a simple game design equation that we think is the foundation for recreating the most visceral world as possible:

```         
emotional realism + cultural realism = the essence of resemblance
```

Note: Photo appears to show Bridges and the Marshals leaving the school. She was escorted both to and from the school while segregationist protests continued.
