# Krita

## je ne sais quoi

. . . is a french term to convey *a quality that cannot be described or named easily*.

This is precisely the reason we use Krita to paint over our rendered images with a touch of dirt, rust, stain, imperfection, and any other marks to enhance the "real-to-life" aesthetic of our game assets.

### art and paint effects


### decals and rebranding


### dirt, rust, and particle stuff
