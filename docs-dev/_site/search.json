But let’s face the harsh reality that it is easier, perhaps even more likely, to make a bad game.\n\nAnother risk is placing high hopes on games designed for the public good—as many nonprofits, health organizations, and social enterprises are doing—without realizing that bad game design can undermine the most noble of ambitions. It’s quite possible to make terrible, dull, and unappealing games for learning or training or health. We need to have a language for discerning among these games—are they doing their job well or poorly? How can you tell? What makes them good?\n\nIn his book Finding Flow, Csikzentmihalyi and his colleagues studied people in a state of flow, identifying eight factors that define the optimal state for getting in the zone:\n\na challenging activity requiring skill\na merging of action and awareness\nclear goals\ndirect, immediate feedback\nconcentration on the task at hand\na sense of control\na loss of self-consciousness\nan altered sense of time\n\nThe application to video games is compelling and provides a useful measure for evaluating the game experience and potential satisfaction of the player. The role of the flow state in games was a point of specific mention for Csikzentmihalyi, observing how games have been developed over the centuries for the express purpose of enriching life with enjoyable experiences, as excellent producers of flow in human beings.\nHow Games Move Us, Emotion by Design\n\nWhat can we learn from others…\nOxenfree, Detention, Deadlight, Tails Noir, Creaks, Machinarium, Dream Alone, Orphan, OddPlanet, Pinstripe, Typoman, Toby, Mosaic, Overland, Disco Elysium, The Swapper, This War of Mine, Huntdown, Journey, My Memory of Us, Gris, Cloudpunk, Beholder 2, The Missing, Nivalis, Liberated, Narita Boy, Shady Part of Me, Book of Travels, White Shadows, Dead Static Drive, Ami, Signalis, The Plane Effect, Replaced, Endzone 2, Calvino Noir, DARQ, Eastwood, INMOST, INSIDE, Monochroma, Northern Lights, Project Highrise\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

But there are a few key points to highlight that serve to differentiate the style from a purely shape and form depiction. Our representation seeks to capture the deeper meaning, symbol, and feeling presented on the game canvas and how we immerse the player into our painted game world.

    "text": "Truthful Realism\n\nRight from the beginning I always strived to capture everything I saw as completely as possible. – Norman Rockwell\n\n\nphotorealism\nPhotorealism of a character is frequently highlighted as the pinnacle achievement in video game graphics. Although advances in computer power and software have made significant progress in this area, photo, stylized, and surreal forms of realism have been achieved for centuries by master artists. For ==KOMPRENI?==, that mastery has a heavy influence on the style and representational design choices we’ve taken in creating the game environment. So let’s take a closer look…\n\n\n\nA recent example of character photorealism from the game StarXXX\n\n\nTake for example, the famed American artist Norman Rockwell. Norman Rockwell’s style of painting is often called photorealism. Indeed, he would eventually use photographs that he took himself to guide his painting, but suggesting his style is a photocopy misses the essence of his work.\nThis is especially true if we consider the current state of photorealism achieved with modern day 3D authoring software and game engine environments. Advances in technology have enabled us to make real-to-life recreations almost indistinguishable from the physical representation. But the reproduction of a photograph is rarely the true expression of artistry or the full measure of a work of art.\n\n\n\nRockwell would use models and photographs as references\n\n\n\n\nHow did he do it?\nAccording to XXX, Rockwell took a stand above and beyond any other artist of his time against prejudice, bigotry, inequality, and against stereotypes that keep us from living the lives we desire. He was also described as having his finger on the pulse of the images he created. This view was earned from his art work and the stories conveyed from his meticulous attention to detail, imagination, and artistic vision.\nThe artistic decisions he took to transform a model or photograph to canvas is something we prefer to describe as a form of emotional-realism – emphasizing his mastery for capturing a moment in life that evokes a sense of feeling.\nWhat can we learn from Rockwell and others like? The lessons are especially important as we try to create a realistic sociological environment to give us inspiration for our learning and experiences to practice in a way that resembles meeting and talking with people as closely as possible.\nThe message here is hopefully worthy of notice. Technology and technical ability can not over take the efforts for bringing life to characters and environments. Taking lessons from Rockwell’s talent to create artworks, a.k.a. game assets, that capture the essence of people and places, we follow these basic principles:\n\nEvery character shall be hand painted with the expressions, gestures, and other characteristics relevant to the situation.\nEvery scene will be created from real-life observed and captured images, as true and completely as possible.\n\nThis leads to a simple game design equation that we think is the foundation for recreating the most visceral world as possible:\nemotional realism + cultural realism = the essence of resemblance\n\n\nemotional realism\n\n\n\nYou can feel it so much it hurts …\n\n\n\n\ncultural realism\n\n\n\nYou can almost taste the turkey … if you’re an American …\n\n\n\n\nthe essence of resemblance\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotion and culture combined - can you feel it?\nCopyright: The Problem We All Live With by Norman Rockwell\n\n\n\n\n\nRuby Bridges with US Marshals in 1960\nWilliam Frantz Elementary School, New Orleans, 1960. \"After a Federal court ordered the desegregation of schools in the South, U.S. Marshals escorted a young Black girl, Ruby Bridges, to school.\" Note: Photo appears to show Bridges and the Marshals leaving the school.

    "text": "One of the most common physical and visible features of the Ugandan landscape is the wall, a barrier with endless forms, that separates something from something. No two are alike, not because of design or deliberate differentiation, but rather because of the organic features that evolve over time like a sculpture formed by the hands of the environment they exist in.\nAs a physical construct, the 3D modelling of a wall is a trivial task. A few primitive geometric forms, some cement texturing, and a game asset is created for a world that can be fittingly named sterile or fake. To present the prop as such in a game world is no different than using a mannequin for a character. As René Magritte would suggest, it is not a wall, and to suggest so would be lying.1\nThe wall example reminds us of the importance of capturing the detail and uniqueness of what we represent. The transformation from mannequin to a living human or from the primitive form of a 3d cube to an artifact so real-to-life you can imagine passing it by as you stroll the streets of the simulated world.\n\n\nIt’s hard to measure the impact attention to detail has in a game. Let’s look at an example and judge with your own reaction how you perceive the difference. We think your reaction is the same shared by all of us.\nWhat you see underscores one of the core and most precious game design decisions we take in creating worlds – that no sight seen or utterance heard is fake.",

In total there were 164 cases (142 confirmed and 22 probable), 55 confirmed deaths and 87 recovered patients. More than 4000 people who came in contact with confirmed cases were followed up and their health monitored for 21 days. Overall, the case-fatality ratio was 47%. The last patient was released from care on 30 November when the 42-day countdown to the end of the outbreak began. On 11 January 2023, Uganda declared the end of the outbreak.2\nPlot\nAccording to Uganda’s health minister, local people believe the new Ebola outbreak is caused by witchcraft. Prior to the first reported case, an 8-year-old girl fell sick with signs of vomiting, bloody diarrhea, fever and headache, potential symptoms of Ebola. Family members thought that it was witchcraft, and instead of taking her to a health facility, the girl was rushed to a traditional healer for treatment. She soon died, without receiving any form of medical diagnosis or care.\nYour task as a public health worker is to raise awareness, educate, and minimize mis-information in high risk areas. You arrive at a “hotspot” District where the first cases emerged. Many in the district only speak Luganda with very limited English ability. Your language skills and ability to communicate factual information will help save lives. Get to work!\nNote: although the story resembles real-life events, it is not intended to serve as a authoritative source.\n\n\n\nWe can take some lessons from Documentary films and the way they are directed to bring viewers into new worlds and experiences through the presentation of factual information about real people, places, and events, generally portrayed through the use of actual images and artifacts.\nWhat does a player expect from the game? 3\n\nTake me to a place I have never been.\nMake me into someone I could never be.\nLet me do things I could never do.\n\nOne of our main objectives is to offer an immersive experience, an objective well-suited for a video game and its exceptional capability to simulate environments and worlds.\nThe strength of interactive games is its immersive flow. This flow, when coupled with story components energizes the experience. The player’s actions have a connection to the underlying story. The goal becomes tangible, something the player is motivated to achieve—and willing to work harder to obtain.\nStory raises the emotional intensity, giving meaning to the rewards of learning the language and gaining increasing levels of fluency.\nIt is the knowledge gained by experience in the game which is instrumental in the success of serious games (i.e., health games). Games enable insights to be gained through experience, as opposed to observation and instruction in traditional linear media and learning methodologies.\nGames and animation both gauge progress by rewards attained or obstacles overcome. But it is in connection to story, where what the player has been through becomes more than just a sense of completion, but rises to a feeling of satisfaction by the end.\nInjecting story into a game provides a context increasing the feeling of immersion and believability, enhancing the suspension of disbelief. The viewer knows who the characters are, their situation, and the relevant artifacts of the story world—all of which imparts meaning to the reactions of the player. In an FPS (e.g., Titanfall or Battlefield), the experience just isn’t as sustaining if the player is killing random people as compared to eradicating international terrorists.\n\nCharacter: who the player identifies with.\nSetting: where, .\nGoal: what the main character wants.\nAction",

    "text": "Path to Proficiency\nAs Vilij is a multi-language learning platform, its success is hinged on a capability to promote skill development for listening, speaking, reading, and writing. To ensure its value for those we hope it benefits, we needed to fully understand the “linguistic” criteria for language learning and gaining fluency. Only after full examination of the various measures and best practices can I have reasonable assurances that Vilij is a viable project that can truly realize its promised benefits and value.\nDrawing from a wide range of references, We’ve aligned the learning experience with practical learning objectives and goals.\n\n1000 words allow you to understand about 80% of the common language which surrounds you.\n3000 words allow you to understand about 95% of most ordinary texts.\n5000 words allow you to understand about 98% of most ordinary text.\n6,000 to 7,000 words to understand 98% of spontaneous spoken language.\n7,000 words to watch and understand a movie.\n8,000 words to read a newspaper.\n8,000-9,000 words to read a novel.\n10000 words allow you to understand about 99% of most texts\n\nAnother key aspect of language learning is to clearly realize the progress and skills gained from the investment of time. Vilij implements a scoring and progress tracking system that aims to “describe” a player’s gains towards language competency and fluency. The measures are based on a simplified interpretation and implementation of three frameworks: the Common European Framework of References (CEFR), The Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) developed by the United States Foreign Service Institute, and the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages scale (ACTFL)25.\nThe fact is, immersion and context are critical to the language learning experience. This point is reinforced by Luca Lampariello24, a well-known polyglot with a popular language learning YouTube channel, who asserts that “context is king”.

( event / action / reaction )\nwhat would the other characters do?

This approach is the foundation for the role-playing design.\n\n\nRole playing\nDuring game play, you “exist” within a virtual world ( city / village ) that resembles the location where the language is spoken. To reinforce the immersive experience, several game design techniques are used to simulate the real-life situations you might experience in-country.\n\nyour journey begins with a village map that can be explored like a virtual self-guided tour.\nyou will navigate to waypoints with an option to enter and launch the level, such as the entrance to a hospital.\neach level represents one or more scenarios, such as entering the hospital to receive emergency care.\nwithin each level are non-player characters ( NPC ) for dialogue (doctor) and interactive objects to build your vocabulary (x-ray machine).\nNPC interaction triggers a text and audio (voice) based dialogue with branching.\nyou are also given opportunities to take on a mission ( non-map-based levels )\ncompleting levels and missions is tracked with score / inventory / progress feedback; the higher the score, the likely increase of fluency.\n\n\n\nLights, Camera, Action, Interaction\nThe video game platform serves as a perfect experiential learning environment, especially for language and cultural studies.

What follows from that moment is where the story begins.\nWriting must be personal or it is not worth writing.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPCs\nNon-player characters (NPCs), populate the world of a game. They shoulder a large portion of the burden of moving the story of the game forward, and come in many shapes and sizes. They also provide a focus for the player’s emotion. The only emotion a player may feel on the death of a player-character who can be resurrected at the beginning of a level or back at a bind point might be frustration. The deaths of thousands of soldiers in a strategy game might mean defeat, but the player will not be attending their funerals as Commander-in-Chief. However, the death of a companion the player-character has adventured with, come to know, even rely upon, can be a potent source for much deeper emotion. We’ll explore this next as we look at major non-player characters.\nStory: Building blocks of plot, character, and dialogue\nVideo games provide a have amazing storytelling power when used to their fullest potential in combining images, sound, and interactivity.\nfilm tells its story in a series of scenes that show action occurring at various times in a number of settings.\nEvery story introduces characters and situations, reveals backstory, creates problems and conflicts for the characters, and then shows how the characters deal with them.\nGood writing and performances are essential ingredients of a compelling movie, but the story will fall short of its potential if the visual storytelling is not well designed. This is because films are primarily stories told in pictures.\nA scene consists of a single time and place where one part of a story takes place.\nA setting can mean the general time and place of an entire story, but more often it’s the specific time and place of one scene.\nVisual structure is based on an understanding of the principle of contrast and affinity.\nContrast Greater Visual Intensity Affinity Less Visual Intensity\n\n\n\n\nthe real-life role you will play …\na player role …\n\n\n\n\nPlanes of Depth\nWhat the camera sees is often divided into the foreground, middle ground, and background. Shots that are composed to show more than one of these planes of depth seem more three-dimensional and immersive. Often a shot can be improved by adding some foreground or by changing the camera angle so that there is more depth in the background behind the actors. When the camera moves, these planes move at varying speeds within the frame, which adds to the illusion of three-dimensionality and motion\nDepth of Field\nA lens can be made to focus on an object at any distance from the camera. The point along the camera’s line of sight where the focus is sharpest is called the focal point. The plane that extends outward from this point at a right angle to the line of sight is called the focal plane. Objects that are somewhat closer or somewhat farther away from that object will also be in focus, while objects that fall outside this range will be out of focus and appear fuzzy and soft. The zone in which objects are in focus is called the depth of field. An object that lies in the focal plane is not in the middle of the depth of field: one-third of the depth of field lies on the camera side of the object, while two-thirds of it lies behind the object.\nIncreasing the Illusion of Depth\n\nLinear Perspective, Distance and Size\nAtmospheric\nCurves and Zigzags\nFocus and Blur\nShadows\nOverlapping\nPerspective Lines (vanishing point)\nReflections\n\nElements of Structure\n\nshots: A shot is a single “take” on an image.\nscenes: A scene is a consecutive group of shots within a single location.\nsequences: A sequence is a collection of shots and scenes that together tell a more or less continuous story of an event that is a piece of your bigger story.\nacts: An act is a series of sequences that drives to a major turning point—a climactic moment that springs directly from the story and makes necessary the next series of sequences in the act that follows.",

This enables to player to enter any level non-sequentially and on-demand.\nFlow, as defined by Csíkszentmihályi (1990), is a state of complete immersion in a given activity. In its purest form, a person experiencing flow would be totally focused on the task at hand, lose track of time, and even fail to notice other stimuli.\nWorking from Csíkszentmihályi’s original research, thatgamecompany (TGC) founder Jenova Chen identifies the following factors that affect the experience of flow: - The presentation of a challenging activity that requires skill - The merging of action and awareness - The setting of clear goals - The provision of direct and immediate feedback - Concentration on the task at hand - Sense of control - Loss of self-consciousness - An altered sense of time\nVirtual Character Design for Games and Interactive Media\nPlayability is the ease by which the game can be played or the quantity or duration that a game can be played and is a common measure of the quality of gameplay. (Usability Glossary)\nPlayability is defined as a set of properties that describe the Player Experience using a specific game system whose main objective is to provide enjoyment and entertainment by being credible and satisfying when the player plays alone or in the company of others. Playability is characterized by different attributes and properties to measure the video game player experience.[21]\nGonzález Sánchez, J. L.; Gutiérrez Vela, F.L.; Montero Simarro, F.; Padilla-Zea, N. (31 Aug 2012). “Playability: analysing user experience in video games”. Behaviour & Information Technology. 31 (10): 1033–1054. doi:10.1080/0144929X.2012.710648. S2CID 7073571.\nSatisfaction: the degree of gratification or pleasure of the player for completing a video game or some aspect like mechanism, graphics, user interface, story, etc. Satisfaction is a highly subjective attribute that provokes a difficult measuring due to player preferences and pleasures influencing the satisfaction for specific game elements: characters, virtual world, challenges, and so on.\nLearning: the facility to understand and dominate the game system and mechanics (objectives, rules, how to interact with the video game, etc.). The Desktop Systems try to minimize the learning effort, but gamers can use the learning curve in video games according to the game’s nature. For example, on the one hand, gamers can demand great initial abilities before playing, or training them harshly in the first phases of the game, to help players understand and dominate all the game rules and resources and use them from the beginning. On the other hand, players can learn step by step in a guided way when they need some ability in the video game.\nEfficiency: the necessary time and resources to offer fun and entertainment to players while achieving the different game objectives and reaching the final goal. An efficient video game can catch the player’s attention immediately and provoke him to continue playing to the end of the game. Efficiency can be analyzed as the correct use of the challenge through the game, the correct structuring of the objectives or the best adaptation of the control to the actions in the game.\nImmersion: the capacity to believe in the video game contents and integrate the player in the virtual game world. The immersion provokes that the player looks involved in the virtual world, becoming part of this and interacting with it because the user perceives the virtual world represented by the video game, with its laws and rules that characterize it. A video game has a good immersion level when it has equilibrium between the proposed challenges and the necessary player abilities to overcome them.\nMotivation: the characteristics that provoke the player to realize concrete actions and persist in them until their culmination. To obtain a high degree of motivation, the game should have resources to ensure the player’s perseverance in the performed actions to overcome the game challenges. This means providing different factors to ensure positive reception in the interpretation of the game process, keeping the player focused on the proposed challenges, showing the relevance of the objectives to reach, and rewards for challenges to keep the player confident and motivated. The player should feel satisfied after receiving the reward or after completing the challenge.\nEmotion: the involuntary impulse, originated in response to the stimulus of the video game and induces feelings or unleashes automatic reactions and conducts. The use of emotions in video games help to cultivate the best player experience and leads players to different emotional states: happiness, fear, intrigue, curiosity, sadness… using the game challenges, story, aesthetic, appearance, or the music compositions that are capable of affecting the player.\nSocialization: the degree of the game attributes, elements and resources that promote the social factor of the game experience in a group. This kind of experience provokes appreciating the video game differently, thanks to the relations established with other players or with other characters of the game that help the player resolve the game challenges in a collaborative, competitive or cooperative way. The game socialization allows players to have a totally different game experience when they play with other persons and promote new social relationships thanks to their interaction. In addition to this, socialization also is present in how the social connections that players have are projected with the group in the characters of the video game and the context in which the game is realized. For example, choosing the player to be connected or to share something, interacting, obtaining information, asking for help, or negotiating for some items, and how our influence with the other character is positive or negative to achieve the game objectives. To promote the social factor, it is advisable to develop new shared challenges that help players to integrate and being satisfied with the new game rules and objectives, creating a set of collective emotions where players (or characters) encourage and motivate themselves to overcome the collective challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Flow and Zone\nEnabling a flow state is one of the most sought-after achievements for a game. While conventional video game design may focus on the balance of challenge versus progression, as a learning platform there are additional considerations.\nThe enjoyment is in the learning, in the perfect balance between player skill and the challenge presented.\nThe five most common experiences of game feel are:\n\nThe aesthetic sensation of control\nThe pleasure of learning, practicing and mastering a skill\nExtension of the senses\nExtension of identity\nInteraction with a unique physical reality within the game\n\nThe Feel of Everyday Things\nEvery new animator has to learn these principles. They comprise a universally applicable set of non-negotiable aesthetic guidelines.\n1 Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston’s “Principles of Physical Animation” are online at http://www.frankandollie.com/PhysicalAnimation.html\nRules Metrics: - Collect 100 coins to get a star. - dialogue points - vocabulary points - experience points measured by repetition + scope (coverage of a subject) + scale (number of subjects covered)? - level of difficulty\nGame Narrative Design is the art of telling a story in a computer game using the techniques and devices available. It is the art of using gameplay and the sum of visual and acoustic methods to create an entertaining and engaging experience for players.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
