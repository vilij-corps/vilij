This includes languages \nlacking a dominant order of object and verb; languages with one of the \nfour less frequent types of relative clauses shown on Map 90, namely \ninternally-headed relative clauses, correlative clauses, adjoined \nrelative clauses, and double-headed relative clauses; and languages \nwhich have two or more of the relative clause types without one being \ndominant.\"\n\nWhat this means is that since Ngiti is OV/VO, it automatically satisfies\n the definition of the fifth type on Map 96, regardless of what type of \nrelative clause it has.  My database does not contain information on \nrelative clauses in Ngiti, but because Ngiti is OV/VO, no information \nabout relative clauses in Ngiti would change the fact that it is Type 5 \non Map 96, so it can be coded as this type even in the absence of \ninformation on relative clauses in the language.",

Now if this interpretation were correct, I think the presence \nof a clear native speaker intuition about default word order should be \nat least a problem to be reckoned with for any theory which says that \nthere is no default. Likewise Dryer 1995's description of SVO as \"basic \nalignment\", \"structurally unmarked\", \"pragmatically neutral\", \"core\" \netc. \n\nHowever, the section in ch.91 makes it clear that in this work, \nfrequency counts, whenever available, are always given priority above \ninformation about what is \"basic\" or \"pragmatically neutral\", because \n\"for most languages, this is the only criterion for which we have any \nrelevant information\". This changes things. While Dryer 1995 says that \n66.8% of the sentences in his corpus of written Bulgarian were SVO, he \nalso says that spoken Bulgarian is more flexible, and I can't exclude \nthe possibility that in some spoken corpus, SVO was found to be less \nthan twice as common as some other word order - while some other corpus \nshowed a somewhat clearer statistical predominance of SVO in Macedonian,\n Serbian-Croatian and Russian, or perhaps no count was available for \nthem at all, leading to a different marking on the map. Even though I \npersonally, non-expert as I am, may have some doubts about the actual \nusefulness of such an approach, I can't deny that it is a legitimate one\n and the authors were entitled to pursue it and apply it consistently.",

Here, \"Agnes\"\n is the Agent, \"Golda\" is the Goal (Recipient), and \"Thelma\" is the \nTheme; and the clause appears to be a \"Double-Object Construction\".\n\nThere are three conceivable reflexivizations, and three conceivable \nreciprocalizations, of such a verb.\n\nI'm interested in valency-reducing inflection of the verb that would \nshow such reflexivization and/or reciprocation.\n\nAgent-Goal Reflexivization would give us:\n\"Agnes show.REFL1 Thelma\", meaning\n\"Agnes shows herself Thelma\", meaning \n\"Agnes shows Agnes Thelma\".\n\nAgent-Theme Reflexivization would give us:\n\"Agnes show.REFL2 Golda\", meaning \n\"Agnes shows herself to Golda\", meaning \n\"Agnes shows Golda Agnes\".\n\nI understand (or, at least, it is my impression that linguists \nunderstand) that in most languages, a reflexive pronoun usually refers \nto its clause's Subject.

On this \nresulting clause, another valency-reducing operation, in particular \neither reflexivizaton or reciprocalization, can again be performed, \nresulting in an intransitive, monovalent clause.\n\nApplying reflexivization on top of reflexivization is boring and I won't\n ask about it here.\nApplying either reciprocalization or reflexivization on top of \nreciprocalization is confusing and I'm not ready to ask about it yet.\n\nBut I want to ask about applying reciprocalization to the result of one \nof the three reflexivizations.\n\nAgent-Goal Reflexivization, followed by Reciprocalization:\n\"Agnes and Thelma show.REFL1.RECIP\", meaning\n\"Agnes show.REFL1 Thelma, and Thelma show.REFL1 Agnes\", meaning\n\"Agnes shows Agnes Thelma, and Thelma shows Thelma Agnes\".\n\nAgent-Theme Reflexivization, followed by Reciprocalization:\n\"Agnes and Golda show.REFL2.RECIP\", meaning\n\"Agnes show.REFL2 Golda, and Golda show.REFL2 Agnes\", meaning\n\"Agnes shows Golda Agnes, and Golda shows Agnes Golda\".\n\nGoal-Theme Reflexivization, followed by Reciprocalization:\n\"Agnes and Golda show.REFL3.RECIP\", meaning\n\"Agnes show.REFL3 Golda, and Golda show.REFL3 Agnes\", meaning\n\"Agnes shows Golda Golda, and Golda shows Agnes Agnes\".\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo,\n finally:\nDoes anyone know which and/or how many languages can inflect \nditransitive verbs with valency-reducing, reflexivizing morphology, and \ncan then inflect the resulting verb with valency-reducing, \nreciprocalizing morphology, to show two or all three of the above \nmeanings?

The morpheme that marks\n polar questions in Yagaria is a clitic that attaches to words of \nvarious word classes, not just to verbs (see an example on p. 101 where \nit attaches to a noun).  As discussed in Chapter 116 (and illustrated in\n example (3) from Fyem), I treat interrogative clitics as a type of \nquestion particle (though I admit this is confusing and I hope in a \nfuture edition of the online WALS to split interrogative clitics off as a\n separate type).",

But that is a marked structure, and most postpositions are simply\n postpositional. If somebody can point me to a source identifying \nsomething that looks more like an inposition in Shoshone, I'd appreciate\n it.",

The \nlast syllable -ga in a number of place names in Iroquoian-speaking areas\n (such as Saratoga and Ticonderoga) is one of these suffixes, and when \nit occurs in names of places, it looks much more like a derivational \naffix than a case affix.  Other uses are more case-like, though they \ncould be still be viewed, perhaps, as derivational.  Its properties are \nsimilar, in fact, to a suffix in Algonquian languages that also shows up\n in many place names in Algonquian-speaking areas (the -ing in \nKapuskasing, the -ish in Antogonish), yet the author of Chapter 49 cites\n this suffix in Cree as an instance of Exclusively borderline \ncase-marking.  However, this suffix it is often described by \nAlgonquianists in a way that makes it look more case-like than the \nanalogous suffixes in Oneida, so this difference between Chap. 49 and \nChap. 51 reflects the fact these locative suffixes in Oneida can be \nanalysed in two different ways..\n\nAs far as Zulu and Swahili are concerned, there is again room for debate\n as to whether the affixes that are treated as case affixes in Chap. 51 \nare really case.  These are certain noun class prefixes, especially \nlocative noun class prefixes, which in the morphological system in Bantu\n languages belong to a set of prefixes that mostly indicate just noun \nclass and number but which, in at least some Bantu languages, are used \nin at least some contexts in a way very similar to the way in which \nlocative case affixes are used in other languages.  And in some Bantu \nlanguages, they code case-like meanings other than location, such as the\n prefix glossed 'with' in eg (2a) in Chap. 51 for Tonga.\n\nLavukaleve has a single locative suffix, but I am not sure why the \nauthor of Chap. 49 didn't code it as a language with Exclusively \nborderline case-marking.  \n\nI code Zuni for Chap. 51 as case suffixing, with an single nonnull case \nthat is used for primary objects and possessors modifying nouns, based \non Nichols 1997.  The author of Chap. 49 based his coding of Zuni based \non Newman (1965).",

Now, it is quite posssible that \n/iwae/ was at some point a locative, but now it only has this more \nmetaphorical 'superioritive' meaning (it implies that the standard NP \n'is no match' for the comparee).

For 'a ~ \nan' to mean the same thing as 'one', it would be necessary that (1) any \ninstance where one can use 'a ~ an', one could use 'one'; and (2) any \ninstance where one can use 'one', one could instead use 'a ~ an'.  But \n(2) is clearly false: 'John was the one person I saw' shows that 'one' \nis not specified for indefinite while 'a ~ an' is.  And while (1) may be\n true in a purely semantic sense, it is not true pragmatically; if a \nnon-native speaker of English used 'a ~ an' and 'one interchangeably, we\n would say that they don't know how to use 'one' correctly.  And even if\n (2) were true, one might say that 'a ~ an' means the same thing as \n'one', but that is irrelevant to the claim that the indefinite article \nin English is distinct from the numeral for 'one'.  There are languages \nin which there is both a dual number word in paradigmatic opposition to a\n plural word and possibly a singular word and the numeral for 'two', \nwhich is in paradigmatic opposition to words meaning 'one', 'three', \n'four', etc.  Even though in one sense, both mean 'two', one is a dual \nword and the other is a numeral.  Similarly, in English, 'a ~ an' is an \narticle and 'one' is a numeral.",

S.\nAnderson's report in his edited Munda Languages volume was a hurried replacement \narticle based on very brief field work, but despite its uncertainties it is not\nincompatible with the majority analysis.\n\nIncidentally, the Sora New Testament of the Canadian Baptist Mission also\nnine vowels written i I e \u00fc \u0259 \u0251 u U o (based on Ramamurti, w/o length or stress),\nwhere \u00fc was Ramamurti's misunderstanding of Sweet's notion \"mixed vowel\", really \u0268.\nThe full Bible was published in the English alphabet, but except for writing \u0259 and \u0251\nboth as a, it also distinguishes the nine vowels (though with many mistakes).   \nA detailed description of Sora phonology and phonetics is in preparation by\nPatricia Donegan, donegan@hawaii.edu.",

In his\n book Intransitive Predication, Stassen has a more fine-grained typology\n in which languages in the Pacific Northwest are coded as languages in \nwhich predicate nominals have verbal encoding, taking affixes that also \noccur on predicate verbs.  His typology also distinguishes languages \nwhich do not employ copulas but where predicate nominals do not take \nverbal encoding, which he classifies as nominal encoding.  When his more\n fine-grained typology was collapsed into two types for WALS, those with\n verbal encoding were, for complex historical reasons, classified with \nlanguages where a zero copula is impossible.  This applies to all \nlanguages with verbal encoding, not just those in the Pacific Northwest.\n  Stassen now agrees that this is very misleading and is planning on \nproducing a version of this map in a future online WALS that employs a \nmore fine-grained typology, in which these languages with verbal \nencoding will be treated as a separate type.",

The same dictionary, if the first \nhalf is Finnish-English and the second half is English-Finnish, which is\n probably the case with Aino Wuolle's dictionary, will attest to both \n\"distinction\" and \"no distinction\".\nI hope that you are able to change the WALS map values.\nFinnish should be in the same group as Northern S\u00e1mi where \"giehta\" \nmeans both 'hand' and 'arm'.\nEstonian \"k\u00e4si\" also means both 'hand' and 'arm'.\nErzya \"\u043a\u0435\u0434\u044c\" also means both 'hand' and 'arm'.\nSincerely,\nJack Rueter, PhD",

Gitksan, like all Tsimshianic languages, marks arguments with a \nset of what are called 'connectives' in the literature, following Boas. \nIn the Interior Tsimshianic dialect continuum, which includes Gitksan \nand Nisgha, there are two basic types, referred to as 'determinate' and \n'non-determinate'. Determinate connectives, which are marked for number,\n introduce proper nouns, demonstratives, and (at least historically) \nindependent pronouns; the single non-determinate connective marks common\n nouns. All the connectives are clitics, not affixes, and precede the \nfirst word of the argument phrase which they introduce. However, the \nnon-determinate connective and some members of the determinate set are \nstrongly enclitic, and therefore attach to the previous prosodic word, \nleading to a syntax-phonology mismatch of the kind found most famously \nin the Northern Wakashan language Kwak'wala. \n    So the Gitksan connectives are not affixes: and they are not \ndefinite either. On common nouns, the non-determinate connective occurs \nwith every kind of argument, including those in strongly indefinite \ncontexts (under the scope of negation and modals, in free choice \nenvironments, etc.). In fact, it is semantically vacuous.\n    This mistake is particularly egregious in that the mutually \nintelligible Nisgha is marked as having *no* definite or indefinite \narticle: but it has an identical connective system! And the closely \nrelated Coast Tsimshian system is given still a *third* value 'definite \ndistinct from demonstrative'! It is true that demonstratives are \ndistinct from the connectives in all Tsimshianic languages - but no-one \nhas ever described the connectives as definite.",

One academic resource I can find to support this claim\n is the following: Alexander, R. (2006). Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, a \ngrammar: with sociolinguistic commentary. University of Wisconsin Press.\n pp. 21-22\n\nParts of it sufficient to support the claim that there are seven \ndistinct cases are available in the Google books preview.\n\nAdditionally, here's a resource in Serbian that says the same thing: \nStanoj\u010di\u0107, \u017d., & Popovi\u0107, L. (1997). Gramatika srpskoga jezika: \nud\u017ebenik za I, II, III i IV razred srednje \u0161kole. Zavod za ud\u017ebenike i \nnastavna sredstva, page 70\n\nThere are some dialects, especially in South Serbia, that may use less \nthan 7 cases (notably, one dialect only uses two, nominative and \naccusative). However, this is not in accordance with the normative \ngrammar of the language, and definitely not what the majority of native \nspeakers would identify as grammatical.\n\nI hope this comment helps correct this uncertainty.",

(logical ?)\n1a) Use to communicate love, affection to interlocutor.\nexample: Je t'aime ! \u0298wa ! (I love you ! [click] !)\n1b) Use to communicate gratitude to interlocutor.\nexample: - Merde ! J'ai oubli\u00e9 mon portable. (- Crap ! I forgot my \ncellphone.)\n- Je te pr\u00eate le mien. (- I lend you mine.)\n- \u0298 ! ([click] ! similar to \"thanks / you're a sweatheart\")\n1c) Express kiss at the sense of \"bye, see you, see ya\" when interrupt a\n communication (can be duplicate)\nexample: Bon j'y vais maman je raccroche \u0298\u0298 (I'm leaving now mummy I \nhang up [click-click] similar to \"bye bye / kiss kiss\")\n1d) (Sarcastically) Use as provocation. Litteraly \"me too I love you\" \nbut means \"Je t'emmerde ; je t'encule\" (I fuck you)\nexample:- C'est quoi ton probl\u00e8me ? Tu cherches la bagarre ? (What's \nyour problem ? You looking for troubles ?)\n- \u0298 ! ([click] ! similar to \"I fuck you / go die\")\n\nII/ Dental clicks [\u01c0] :\n1) Express exasperation or irritation when long and alone (clearly \naffective meanings). \"Nttt...\" = pfff...\n2) Meaning negative answer when quicly duplicate (clearly logical \nmeaning). \"Nt-t.\" = no, not yet, disagree, oppose)\n3) Strong disapproving warning when repeted at least thrice and clearly.\n \"Nt-t-t-t-t-t !\" = stop!, don't even try!, don't do that!\n4) Express impatience when repeted lightly and continuously (clearly \naffective meanings). \"Nt-t-t-t-t-t...\" = distraction to pass the time\n\nIII/ Alveolar clicks [\u01c3] :\n1) A way to say \"In your face\" to deride someone after a bad things \nhappen to him.\nexample:- Tu ne devrais pas toucher ce c\u00e2ble, il est sous tension. (You \nshouldn't touch this cable, it's on tension.)\n- Laisse faire les pros, ok ?... A\u00efe ! (Let do the boss, ok ?... Ouch !)\n- Et [\u01c3] ! Je te l'avais dit. (Et [click] ! I told you.)\n\nIV/ Lateral clicks [\u01c1] :\n1) Meaning positive answer. (yes, it's done, agree, support)\n\nI have a microphone, and I'm able to reproduce and record all that kind \nof clicks if you're interested by illustrations.

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am not a linguist--instead, I am a student of linguistics (on the \nundergraduate level) who speaks fluent German and French.\nThough I understand this project focuses on a wider scope of languages \nthan traditionally taught in universities; though I have little \nknowledge of languages outside English, French and the Germanic \nlanguages (as I have just discovered, a very narrow scope!); and though I\n have not read the literature given as a reference, I will say that I \nthink saying that French is a language which builds its plural form \nprimarily by a suffix is contrary to everything I've been learning in my\n French linguistics course.\nOr, at the very least, is only applicable to the written language, which\n I don't believe is the form of the language examined here.\nIndeed, in modern spoken French, the final letter of plural forms are \nnot pronounced, as is well known--of course, this normally means that \nsingular and plural forms are homophonous. (There is no spoken \ndifference between \"chat\" and \"chats\".) Instead, to mark the plural, you\n use an article beforehand.\nIn fact, articles are the only functional way to mark number in French. \nThe difference between \"le (1) chat\" and \"les (>1) chats\" can be \nrealized as such in a phonetic transcription:[l\u0259\u0283a] -- [le\u0283a]. As can be\n observed, it is the article beforehand that carries the difference \nbetween the two. Although in some cases, number is also post-determined \n(\"le cheval\" -- \"les chevaux\") [l\u0259\u0283\u025bval] -- [le\u0283\u025bvo], this only affects \nsuch a small class of nouns that renders it unproductive.\nOf course, in written French, the difference is clear because there is \nan -s or some other similar ending on the end.\nOther languages, like German, also use articles to differentiate number.\n What makes German different than French in this respect is a number of \nthings: (1) the plural articles are sometimes allomorphic with other \nsingular articles (ex. \"die Katze\" [the cat] and \"die Katzen\" [the \ncats]), (2) plural endings in German are realized in speech (ex. \"die \nKatzen\" is pronounced [di: katsn] and is clearly opposed to \"die Katze\" \n[di: kats\u0259]), and (3) though there are cases in which the plural and \nsingular are the same (\"der B\u00e4cker\" {the baker} and \"die B\u00e4cker\" {the \nbakers}), this never happens in the feminine and forms only a small \nclass of masculine and neuter nouns whose number is only marked by the \narticle beforehand. Traits like this mean that German's primary way to \ncode plurality is indeed by use of a suffix, even when there are \nexceptions.\nOn the other hand, French codes plurality almost exclusively by using \none of the plural clitics \"des\" or \"les\". In certain cases, this must be\n derived from context, so that even a case like \"Il y a beaucoup de \nchevaux.\" (There are many horses.) where only the -aux ending shows \nplurality morphologically can hardly be taken as an exception seeing as \nthe word \"beaucoup\" lexically already codifies plurality. (Compare with \nEng. \"a lot of\", which also codifies plurality lexically so that plural \nendings are here technically superfluous and there is no question that \nthe word \"deer\" in \"a lot of deer\" is plural.)\n\nIndeed, I understand there's a lot of problems with any phenomenon in \nFrench. Still, I fail to see how French can be classified as having a \nplural suffix given the aforementioned information...\nAnd I would be interested to see what other people have to say.",

        "text": "Thank you for bringing \nthese to our attention.  Let me respond as the author of Chapter 33.\n\nFirst, it is important to consider the following general point:\n\n1.  The chapters have different authors and no attempt was made to make \nthe different chapters consistent with each other.\n2.  Different authors occasionally used slightly different criteria.\n3.  There are often borderline cases.  While I attempted to always apply\n the same criteria, the fact that the data for my database has been \ncollected over a period of over thirty years means that occasionally I \nwas not consistent in applying exactly the same criteria in deciding \nborderline cases.\n\nIt is also important to \u201cread the fine print\u201d.  In Chapter 33, the \nfeature value \u201cNo plural\u201d is more accurately defined in \u201cThe final type \nshown on the map are languages apparently lacking a morphological plural\n ...\u201d.  In other words, this feature value leaves open the possibility \nthat a language of this type might code plurality by a separate word; it\n only claims that the language doesn\u2019t code plurality on the noun \nitself.  The reason for defining this feature value in this way is that \nin the earlier years collecting data for my database, I did not look for\n coding of plurality by separate words.\n\nThis last factor explains the inconsistency in the coding of Coptic and \none of two elements in Mparntwe Arrernte (Wilkins 1989: 129) that Martin\n Haspelmath (the author of Chapter 34) treated as coding plurality.  Now\n that I am aware of these, the coding of both of these languages for \nChapter 33 will be changed from No Plural to Plural Word.\n\nAnother factor behind some of the inconsistencies is that I did not \ncount something as a plural marker unless its meaning was simply \nplurality.  Some languages have markers of \u201ccollectivity\u201d, which are \nclose to being plural markers but have the added meaning that the set \ndenoted forms a well-defined group.  One of the phenomena in Mparntwe \nArrernte that Haspelmath apparently treated as a coding of plurality is a\n marker of collectivity (Wilkins 1989: 110).  The same is true of one of\n the phenomena that Haspelmath treated as a plural marker in Tauya.  On \nthe other hand, I treated a word in Mapudungun as a plural word on the \nbasis of Augusta (2003).  But it is clear from Smeets (2008), the source\n used by Haspelmath, that this word is a collective marker, not a plural\n marker, so the value for Mapudungun for Chapter 34 will be changed to \nNo Plural.\n\nThe suffix in Ngalakan that Haspelmath apparently treated as a plural \nmarker, I did not, since it has a more specific meaning.  It is a suffix\n that when added to symmetrical kin terms (like \u2018brother\u2019) has \nreciprocal meaning, e.g., denoting a set of people who are brothers of \neach other.  When added to asymmetric kin terms, like \u2018father\u2019, it \ndenotes the set consisting of the father and the set of individuals that\n he is father of.\n\nThe description of the number-like suffixes in Alyawarra by Yallop \n(1977: 85) suggests that none of them are really simply plural markers. \n However, I missed a statement at the foot of p. 88 that says that one \nof them can be used as just a plural marker.  So Chap. 33 should code \nAlyawarra as having a plural suffix.\n\nI did not treat a language as having plural marking if it occurs only on\n a very small number of nouns.  But my coding of Harar Oromo as lacking a\n plural suggests that many years ago I had a somewhat more lax standard \nas what counts as \u201cvery small\u201d.  Today, I would consider three or less \nto be very small.  But Harar Oromo has plural marking for at least ten \nnouns, so by my current criteria, it should be coded as having a plural \nsuffix.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the phenomena that Haspelmath seems to have \ntreated as a plural marker in Tauya, I did not so treat since it is \ndescribed as \u201crarely attested\u201d.\n\nAnother marginal case is presented by Pero, where a small number of \nnouns have plural forms, all of which are suppletive.  I did not treat \nlanguages where all plurals of nouns were suppletive as having a plural \nsince in such cases I consider plurality to be part of their lexical \nmeaning rather than grammatical plural (somewhat analogous to a noun \nmeaning \u2018wife\u2019 being lexically feminine, but not reflecting a feminine \ngender), though one could just as easily analyse them differently.\n\nIn the case of Nias, my coding it as having a plural prefix is clearly \nan error.  There is an associative plural prefix, but I do not in \ngeneral treat associative plural affixes as plural affixes, so Nias \nshould be coded in Chapter 33 as lacking a plural.\n\nThe last inconsistency is Kana.  Although Ikoro (1996) describes a word \nthat he calls a specifier as having collective meaning, the discussion \nsuggests that it is simply a plural marker since in the absence of a \npossessive pronoun, the noun phrase is interpreted as indefinite (while I\n consider a true collective marker as inherently definite).  I\u2019m not \nsure why Haspelmath did not include it (since it is somewhat analogous \nto the plural forms of articles in Mparntwe Arrernte and Coptic).",

If that was the case, I'd understand, \nbut as it stands, it appears as though this portion describes Japanese \nas not possessing this consonant value at all, which is false. For \nexample, you cite Shibatani as one of your sources, but in his book he \nhimself comments on how even recently the distinction between internal \n/\u014b/ and /g/ has been changing. I speak Japanese fluently myself, and I \ncan assure you, the Japanese internal /\u014b/ is still very much alive and \nactive. Even without the /\u014b/ and /g/ distinction, the moraic nasal \u3093 \nbecomes /\u014b/ before /g/ and /k/, so it exists internally all the same. \nJust adding my two cents on the matter. \n\nRegards.",

In fact, the \ninterpretation in the chapter is correct, as Latvian does indeed exploit\n the PRS.2SG form as the 2SG imperative. The situation with the 2PL \nplural is a bit tricky. The example here in WALS is not exactly the \ndedicated form, which would be rather Run\u0101jiet! (where -iet- is a \nsuffix/ending specific for the imperative only)\n\nThe tricky thing is that the PRS.2PL in the imperative function indeed \noccurred in old texts and still occurs in non-standard Latvian, but the \nform here in the chapter is even not the present, but the past form of \nthe verb 'to say, to speak' (the present would be Run\u0101jat!)",

        "text": "Of course Canary Island\n Spanish is not a \\different language\\ than Standard Spanish; several \nWALS maps include more than one dialect of the same language, and for \ngood reason \u2014 in many cases, WALS features cross-cut individual \nlanguages, with different dialects of the same language displaying \ndifferent feature values.  As you correctly point out, this is not one \nof those cases; for this feature, the Canary Islands dialect has the \nsame feature value as the standard language \u2014 but negative data can be \njust as important as positive data.  In the case at hand, \npara-linguistic clicks exhibit interesting areal patterns in Africa and \nthe Mediterranean region, so it was of interest to see what happens in a\n geographically remote variety of Spanish.  In fact, in an update to \nthis map (in preparation), there will be substantially more data from \nvarious dialects of Italian and Arabic.",

But that does not seem to be \nthe case of Spanish (or English). As I see it, the only WALS feature in \nwhich it is worth making a distinction between Standard Peninsular \nSpanish and other varieties is feature 19A (presence of uncommon \nconsonants). This is because Peninsular Spanish speakers usually use the\n phoneme /th/, while most other varieties (almost all Latin American \nspeakers, and also most Canary Island speakers) merge that phoneme with \n/s/. However, WALS does not report that difference, and in feature 19A \nit classifies Spanish as a language in which the uncommon consonant \"th\"\n is present (although it is not present in the varieties of Spanish \nsponken by 90% of the Spanish speakers). In the case of feature 142A, \nconversely, all Spanish speakers use clicks to express \"affective\" \nrather than \"logical\" meanings, and that is why I think that it is not \nworth it to distinguish between Standard Spanish and Canary Island \nSpanish.",

Nandi is not contained \nin the sample.\n\nOther than these two, there seem to be no non-Bantu languages in \nimmediate Bantu vicinity with remoteness distinction. \nIf Bantu is more or less uniform in this regard, this could inspire the \nsuspicion that Khoekhoe and Nandi adapted to Bantu.\nOr is there evidence for the opposite direction?",

London: Routledge: 286-306.\n\nGeorg classifies Mongghul and Mangghuer as two languages in a small \nfamily. As is standard in the Mongolist literature, Georg refers to the \ncontrast between p t c ch q k and b d z zh j g gh as 'strong' vs. \n'weak', not voiceless vs. voiced. \"In nitial position, the two classes \nof obstruents are phonetically distinguished by aspiration, the strong \nsegments (fortes) being voiceless and aspirated, while the weak segments\n (lenes) are equally voiceless (or slightly voiced), but unaspirated. In\n medial position, however, the weak segments can be fully voiced and \nspirantized\" (2003: 291). He then goes on to describe a series of \ndiachronic developments in M: medial strong Cs are lenited to their weka\n counterparts in disyllabic roots with initial strong Cs, and disyllabc \nroots with initial weak Cs and medial strong Cs reverse them. The result\n is \"if aspiration is taken to be the relevant feature on which the \ndistinction between the strong and weak obstruents is based, the \nsituation in Mongghul can be reformulated as follows: MOngghul allows at\n most one aspirate consonant per stem, and only in initial position \n(292).\n\nI take this as an argument that the larygneal contrast for obstuents in \nthis Mongolic language should be aspiration, not voicing.",

In summary, at least it seems to me, that Basque\n should be listed as having a weak prefence for suffixing. I haven't \ndone any quantitative analysis though.\n\nThat feature mentioned at the bottom of the list (subordination, 94A) \nalso looks rather incorrect for Basque. Basque clearly uses mixed \nstrategies. To illustrate, I'm translating some of the example sentences\n from the chapter, that are realized by affixes in Basque:\n\n- prefixal: gelditzen ba-zara (if you stay) vs. gelditzen zara (you stay\n / are staying)\n- suffixal: lan egiten duzu-lako (because you work) vs. lan egiten duzu \n(you work / are working)\n\nPlease feel free to contact if you have any further questions or \ncomments on how you arrived at the parameter values for Basque.\nThank you!",

        "text": "Scott AnderBois\u2019 \ncomment says our examples of Tagalog associative plurals involve a \nplural pronoun juxtaposed with a proper name and he proposes that this \nis the coordination of the pronoun and the proper name rather than an \nassociate plural construction.\n\nHowever, according to the sources that we have, this is not so: what is \njuxtaposed with a proper name to yield the associative interpretation is\n not a plural pronoun but a plural marker of personal nouns. These \npersonal-noun plural markers are sina, nina, and kina (three case \nforms), while the plural third person pronoun forms are distinct: sila, \nnila, and kanila (Schachter and Otanes 1972, 88, 112-113). Since the \nconstructions do not contain two noun phrases (a pronoun and a noun), it\n cannot be interpreted as coordination. \n\nWe cited two sources for the Tagalog associative plural. Both of them \nare explicit about a personal-noun plural marker directly followed by a \nproper name yielding an associative plural meaning. \n\nOne source is Schachter and Otanes (1972: 113). Here is the relevant \npassage.\n\n\u201cA phrase consisting of a plural marker and personal noun means: the \nperson named by the noun and another or others associated with that \nperson. Thus, sina Maria has the general meaning \u2018Maria and (the) \nothers\u2019. In specific instances it may mean \u2018Maria and her friend(s)\u2019, \n\u2018Maria and her companion(s)\u201d, \u2018Maria and her relative(s)\u2019, etc. Some \nexamples of pluralized person-noun phrases are:\n\n  Masasaya na sina Maria.         \u2018Maria and the others are happy now.\u2019\n  Siya ang Iola nina Boy.         \u2018She is the grandmother of Boy and the\n others.\u2019\n  Para kina Luis ang handaan.     \u2018The party is for Luis and the \nothers.\u2019\u201d\n\n(End of quote.)\n\nSchachter and Otanes (113) also note that names have two plurals one \nyielding an additive plural, the other an associative plural. For \nexample, ang nga Santos means \u2018the Santoses\u2019, while sina Santos means \n\u2018Santos and others (who may or may not also be named Santos)\u2019.\n\nOur other source was Agnes Kolmer\u2019s paper of 1998. She cites an example \nfrom L. Bloomfield\u2019s Tagalog texts with grammatical analysis (1917) with\n the translation given in German. The gloss PNM presumably stands for \n\u2018personal name\u2019.\n\nsina        Hw\u00e0n, sina            Andr\u00e8s, at     sina    ariy\u00e1no\nPNM.PL.ANG  H.        PNM.PL.ANG  A.      und PNM.PL.ANG M.         \n\u2018Juan, Andres, und Mariano, jeder mit seiner Gruppe\u2019\n(\u2018Juan, Andres, and Marian, each with his/her group\u2019)\n\nIn the light of these data and analyses, we see no reason to modify our \nclaim that  Tagalog has an associative plural construction. We are sorry\n that in our original description we did not make clear the grammatical \nnature of the item that, followed by a name, yields the associative \nplural reading. We would welcome any additional information on the \nmatter including from Scott\u2019s personal knowledge of the language if \npossible.\n\nMichael Daniel and Edith Moravcsik",

A few are cited below:\ntuy'=hi\u0294 \"is it true\"?

But I am not sure it this form\n is actually productive in modern European Portuguese, since the use of \nthe second person plural pronoun \"v\u00f3s\" is rare in Portugal, mostly \nreplaced by \"voc\u00eas\", which requires a third person agreement.\n\nIn Brazilian Portuguese, this verbal form for second person plural \nimperatives was complementely lost, altogether with the pronoun \"v\u00f3s\". \nBut in Brazilian portuguese, we also have something different with the \nsecond person singular. The forms for second person singular imperatives\n were not lost nor changed. They remain the same. For example: \"canta\" \npor \"cantar\" [ sing ]. But the verb forms for second person singular \nINDICATIVES have changed, losing the final \"s\": \"tu cantas\" [ you.SG \nsing ] changed for \"tu canta\" or \"voc\u00ea canta\". So, now, there is no \nexclusive form for imperatives in BP anymore, due to a change in the \nindicative form.\n\nOne can read more about this in: CAVALCANTE, Rerisson. (2011). Negative \nImperatives in Portuguese and Other Romance Languages. In: HERSCHENSOHN,\n Julia (ed.). Romance Linguistics 2010: Selected papers from the 40th \nLinguistic Symposium on Romance Linguistics (LSRL).",

This is noted by Gordon (1986:29): \"The \nnouns which have plural forms are all animate and most are human\", and \nthis is supported by examples like \"xat\" [xat] 'dog' (pl. \"xaat\" [xa:t] \n'dogs'; Gordon 1986:29, Langdon et al. 1991) and \"mo s'aw\" [mo s\u0294aw] \n'lamb' (pl. \"mo ts'osh\" [mo ts\u0294o\u0283] 'lambs'; Langdon et al. 1991). The \ntendency for human nouns to have plural forms likely reflects the fact \nthat (a) verbs are what are marked for plurality in Yuman languages, and\n those nouns which have plural forms tend to derive from verbs having \nplural forms, and (b) that many of these human nouns derive from such \nverb forms (Langdon 1992).\n \nReferences\nGordon, Lynn. 1986.

Here, the criterion is animacy. It is very interesting what \nall of you are saying about the modern spoken Persian, but note for \nChrist\u2019s sake that the indicated value concerns the literary Persian. Or\n is it simply the case that you don\u2019t quite master it?\nThere are reliable sources that confirm the animacy distinction between \nu/vey on the one hand and aan on the other hand (e. g. Rubin\u010dik, J. A. \n2001. Grammatika sovremennogo persidskogo literaturnogo jazyka. Moskva: \nIzdatel\u2019skaja firma \u201cVosto\u010dnaja literatura\u201d RAN, p. 170). Irrespective \nof the fact that aan is actually a demonstrative, one cannot forgo using\n it when referring pronominally to inanimate referents in 3SG. \nTherefore, it is warranted to say that gender distinction exists in this\n combination of grammemes in this grammatical domain of literary \nPersian. \nCan you first do some research and express your doubts then? I wasted a \nquarter of an hour of my precious lifetime reading the invalid ones \nexpressed in this section and doing the ensuing research for you.",

In your study, the information on epistemic expressions in \nAmharic has been taken from Leslau, and quite right. The problem is that\n there are two expressions which could refer to the notion of epistemic \npossibility in Amharic: a modal auxiliary 'y\u01ddhonall' (which you provide \nreference to) and another, less grammaticalized expression, 'y\u01dd\u010d\u01ddlall' \nwhich I find a better equivalent of the English 'may'. 'Y\u01dd\u010d\u01ddlall' is \nalso polyfunctional and has gone through the same path of \ngrammaticalization (from ability to epistemcity) as some modal verbs in \nSAE languages. I do not know how much you stick to the idea that an \nepistemic expression in a given language should be as closest an \nequivalent of the English 'may' as possible. The modal 'y\u01dd\u010d\u01ddlall' comes \nfrom the verb '\u010dal\u00e4' (be able, can) but it gains the epistemic meaning \nonly in the imperfective form preceeded by a complementizer 'l\u01dd-' + \nimperfective form of the main verb. Leslau was unaware of the existemce \nof this construction (at least he does not mention it explicitely in his\n reference grammar).  \nAnother important point is that there is a semantic difference between \nthe two expressions and they are not mutually substituitable. What is \nthen the range of meanings that fall under the lable 'epistemic \npossibility' in your study? Anything that can be successful translated \ninto English as epistemic 'may'? But what meaning it conveys? What does \nit mean 'epistemic possibility' in your case?\n\nWith best regards,\nMagdalena Krzyzanowska",

Articulated adjectives are always preceded by an \nadjectival article (a proclitic) that inflects according to case, \nnumber, and gender, but the adjectival article is an integral part of an\n articulated adjective and is present whether the adjective determines a\n noun or stands by itself.

It is true that \nanimacy-marking is also involved here, as only persons and quadrupeds \nare marked with this case suffix -ash at all, whether as the direct \nobject or as recipient / addressee. Naturally, in the vast majority of \nditransitive verb constructions, the recipient / addressee is animate \nand the object given or thing told is not animate.\nFor the record, although it is not included in WALS yet, the related \nPlateau Penutian language Ichishk\u00edin (Sahaptin) has the same \nsecondary-object construction (Jansen 2010: 324), again based on the \nhuman object taking the case suffix, in this case -nan. But in \nIchishk\u00edin, unlike in Klamath, an inanimate direct object of a simple \ntransitive verb *does* take this case suffix -nan (Jansen 2010: 160), \nalthough there are particular grammatical constructions where a human or\n topical object is marked with -nan but other objects are not.\nIt is notable that dependent-marking languages with inflectional noun \ncase affixes and such a secondary-object construction are \nextraordinarily rare: WALS only identifies a few languages in Australia \nand in Papua New Guinea as having this combination of features.",
