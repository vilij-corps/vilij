The collection of XLSX files located in this directory contain manually defined language distance categories between language pairs within language families
or other groupings. Each spreadsheet contains matched rows and columns containing the list of language codes along the top and left of the table, with the distance/relatedness
between the pair of languages entered in the lower triangular area of the spreadsheet. The defined distance values represent the following:

* 0: The pairing of the same language in the matrix
* 1: Languages proposed as dialects of each other
* 2-8: Scalar values ranging from 2 (closely related) to 8 (distantly related)
* 9: Languages with contested degree of relatedness
* 10: No proposed relationship
