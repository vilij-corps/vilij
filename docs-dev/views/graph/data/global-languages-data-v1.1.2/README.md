This repository contains language characteristics and distance information in support of global language-environmental analyses.

The `v-languages.csv` file contains the data generated by the workflow shared through the [global-languages-analysis](https://github.com/karlbenedict/global-languages-analysis) GitHub repository [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/567860220.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/567860220)

The `attributes` folder contains files containing language attribute data as an Excel spreadsheet and XML data that enable reading of those data into the GRASS GIS analytic environment. The README.txt file in this folder provides a list of all of the language attributes encoded in the Excel spreadsheet.

The `distances` folder contains preliminary distance matrices for paired languages within language family subgroups. These matrices include qualitative distance values that range from 1 (the same language), 2-8 for languages with increasing inheritance distance, 9 for languages for which there is substantial disagreement about their shared family, and 10 for languages that are not part of the same highest-level family.
