Detention is a 2D side-scroller point-and-click video game set in 1960s Taiwan during the White Terror period. The game also incorporates Taiwanese culture and mythology in the form of ghosts. The game visuals feature a cardboard style of animation utilizing dreary and unsettling colors that create an old photograph aesthetic with a sinister look and feel, the perfect setting for a horror game.

Detention also excels at creating contrast. Part of this is due to the game’s smart use of lighting, a mainstay of decent horror design, but the game’s artists expertly balance light and dark to create some truly forbidding areas. 

### What can we learn?

`The side-scrolling environment is eerie and scary with an attention to detail that never lets you forget where you are or the nightmare unfolding.  Rain adds to the spooky feel.  Light and dark contrast create mystery and suspense.`
