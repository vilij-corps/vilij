# Oxenfree

Oxenfree is a game developed by Night School Studio.  It is a 2.5D styled game with multi-directional player movement in a hand-painted environment.

### What can we learn?

The story is guided by an expressive branching dialogue system reinforced with speech bubbles, and audio voice overs, with character poses and animation resembling the non-verbal gestures and behaviors we expect to see in a similar real-life dialogue.  A visual cue overlay shows the player which objects can be interacted with.
