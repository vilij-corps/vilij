# Storyboarding

Storyboarding is a planning and pre-visualization process for designing a frame-by-frame blueprint of a story. Storyboards are representations used to plan and design your visual narrative by arranging a series of shots in a sequence to reveal your story. It enables you to explore design options such as choosing the highest impact frames, levels of detail, pace and tempo, and transitions for presenting the story.
