# To Play is to Feel

### Inspiring Emotion

*Why should I care?*

According to XYZ, there are three levels of emotion for a game player.

1. Voyeuristic — you're curious
2. Vicarious — you identify with what the characters are feeling
3. Visceral — you have emotional reactions to the story

From a learning and game design perspective, we see each of these levels as emotions that can incentivize and reinforce the learning experience.


- Setting up the player to understand a role’s reactions. For example, audiences may not feel empathy for a sad child until they know **why** the child is sad.
- A realistic situation that the viewer can relate to. This is especially important for the role-playing aspect of the game and the sense of immersion.
