There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.

Vilij is an immersive learning experience for indigenous languages. The project is the development of a
language learning video game that bridges the gap of communications and enables
cross-cultural relationship building.

Vilij is designed to simulate the location-specific features where the language is spoken as if
you are there. It emulates the unique behavioral, cultural, ethnic, identity, and societal
characteristics of those who speak the language with real-to-life dialogue and interactivity. To
reinforce experiential learning, it provides role-playing and scenario-based experiences to
practice the language in context and reinforce retention with multi-sensory and emotional cues
based on real-life activities, actions, and events that you may face. 

The game is designed to reinforce language learning with interactive experiences that enrich
the understanding of the location such as current events and daily living to help you understand,
adapt to, and succeed in the environment. Like most video games, the learning experience is
incentivized with challenges, missions, progress tracking, and scoring to measure your developing fluency

We envisage a benefit to expatriate learners in the fields of development and
humanitarian aid, diplomacy, military, and civil affairs for emergency and crisis response, as
well as non-governmental, community, and volunteer organizations. The game can also lead to
direct benefits with awareness campaigns and education for public health, governance, safety,
security, and voting, as exemplified with the Ebola scenario. The value should also be evident in
business, communications, and marketing, creating opportunities by breaking communication
boundaries.

For indigenous learners, the benefits can lead to greater empowerment and self-determination.
It can help learners become multilingual, for example, as a resource to learn English for those
who do not have access to a formal education. It can promote cultural and heritage language
proficiency within the community.
