On 20 September 2022, Uganda declared an Ebola disease outbreak caused by the Sudan ebolavirus species. In total there were 142 confirmed cases leading to 55 deaths and 87 recovered patients. More than 4000 people who came in contact with confirmed cases were followed up and their health monitored for 21 days. Overall, the case-fatality ratio was 47%. The
last patient was released from care on 30 November when the 42-day countdown to the end of the outbreak began. On 11 January 2023, Uganda declared the end of the outbreak.

According to Uganda's health minister, local people believe the new Ebola outbreak is caused by witchcraft. Prior to the first reported case, an 8-year-old girl fell sick with signs of vomiting, bloody diarrhea, fever and headache, potential symptoms of Ebola. Family members thought that it was witchcraft, and instead of taking her to a health facility, the girl was rushed to a
traditional healer for treatment. She soon died, without receiving any form of medical diagnosis or care.

Your task as a public health worker is to raise awareness, educate, and minimize mis-information in high risk areas. You arrive at a "hotspot" District where the first cases emerged. Many in the district only speak Luganda with very limited  English ability.

Your language skills and ability to communicate factual information will help save lives
